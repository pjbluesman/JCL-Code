--                   DB2 CORRECTIVE MAINTENANCE
--                      IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
* FOR 12/14/94
*
SUBSYSTEM(S):  DB2D, DB2T, DSNA
SYSMOD(S) BEING INSTALLED:
       UN68129 (RECOMMENDED BY IBM)
*
*
*
PRIOR TO STOPPING SUBSYSTEMS OR IPL:
-----------------------------------
1) OVERLAY DATA IN FOLLOWING LOADLIBS FOR SUBSYSTEMS AS ABOVE USING
   'SSXDP.DB2V3.DSNI.TEMP.XXXXXXXX' TO CLONE FROM:
    ADSNLOAD, ADSNMACS, SDSNCLST, SDSNMACS, SDSNSAMP, SDSNSPFP,
    SDSNSPFM
IF IPL PLANNED, DO NEXT TWO STEPS PRIOR TO SYSTEM SHUTDOWN; ELSE
STOP DB2 NOW.
2) COPYMOD CHANGES TO SDSNLOAD FOR EACH SUBSYSTEM
3)RE-ASSEMBLE DSNZPARMS FOR EACH SUBSYSTEM BY RUNNING THE APPROPRIATE
DSNTIJUZ JOB.
4)IF NEEDED, RUN DSNTIJSU FOR EACH SUBSYSTEM TO  RE-LINK CICS LOAD
MODULES INTO THE ATTACHEMENT CODE.
5) IF NO IPL, REFRESH LLA TO PULL IN CHANGES INTO SDSNLOAD.  USE MEMBER
'CSVLLAD2' IN SYS5T(P).LLA.PARMLIB.  COMMAND TO REFRESH FROM SYSLOG:
   /F LLA,UPDATE=D2
RESTART SUBSYSTEMS OR IPL HERE:
1) VERIFY ALL SUBSYSTEMS STARTED AND ALL CICS ATTACHMENTS MADE TO THE
SUBSYSTEM, AS APPROPRIATE.
2) VERIFY BASIC SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY AND 3RD PARTY PRODUCT ATTACHEMENTS.
*
*
BACKOFF PROCEDURES:
------------------
IF BACKOFF REQUIRED, PROCESS AS FOLLOWS:
1) STOP AFFECTED SUBSYSTEM(S).
2) FALLBACK TO PREVIOUS LOADLIBS BY REPLACING WITH BACKUP COPIES:
   A.  DATASETS TO BE BACKED OFF TO HAVE 'FB' SUFFIX AND
   B.  ONES WITH SUFFIX 'P1'; REMOVE IT TO BE CURRENT VERSION
3) REFRESH LLA WIT H SAME PROCEDURE AS IN 5 ABOVE.
4) RESTART SUBSYSTEMS AND VERIFY AS ABOVE UNDER IMPLEMENTATION
