DB2 VERSION 3 MIGRATION ISSUES
ALL DB2 APPLICATIONS ARE PLANNED TO MIGRATE FROM DB2 VERSION 2.3 TO
VERSION 3 DURING FOURTH QUARTER 1994. BELOW ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT MAY
OR MAY NOT APPLY TO EACH SITUATION. PLEASE CONSIDER THE IMPACT ON YOUR
AREA AND CONTACT DB2 SUPPORT IF YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS. WE WILL PROVIDE
MORE INFORMATION AND SCHEDULES WELL IN ADVANCE.
*
MAJOR CHANGES IN DB2 VERSION 3
------------------------------
*
PARTITION INDEPENDENCE ALLOWS SOME WORK ON ONE PARTITION WITHOUT
AFFECTING OTHERS.
*
BUFFER POOLS CAN BE CONTROLLED DYNAMICALLY.
*
HIPERPOOL EXTENSIONS TO BUFFERPOOLS ALLOW INCREASED CAPACITY.
*
ARCHIVE LOG READ ENHANCEMENTS REDUCE UNPLANNED RECOVERY TIME.
*
DATA COMPRESSION IS BUILT INTO DB2 AND TAKES ADVANTAGE OF AVAILABLE
HARDWARE IMPROVEMENTS.
*
DFSMS CONCURRENT COPY CAN BE USED TO COPY TABLESPACES A THEN INVOKE
THE DB2 RECOVER UTILITY TO APPLY CHANGES FROM THE LOG.
*
THE COPY, RUNSTATS AND QUIESCE UTILITY CAN BE RUN ON DATA THAT IS
LOCKED EXCLUSIVELY.
*
MULTI-SITE UPDATES ARE NOW SUPPORTED.
*
CICS DISTRIBUTED APPLICATIONS CAN NOW UPDATE DATA AT REMOTE SITES
THAT SUPPORT DRDA AND TWO-PHASE COMMIT.
*
MORE DISTRIBUTED CONNECTIONS ARE ALLOWED.
*
PARALLEL I/O PROCESSING CAN HELP REDUCE QUERY RESPONSE TIME IN
LIMITED SITUATIONS.
*
IMPROVED I/O SCHEDULING PRIORITY FOR CONCURRENT QUERY AND BATCH JOBS.
*
UNIFORM SYSTAX FOR DIFFERENT UTILITIES. (OLD SYSTAX STILL WORKS)
*
THE QUISCE AND RECOVER UTILITIES NO LONGER LIMIT THE NUMBER OF TABLES.
*
THE SUBSYSTEM IDENTIFIER IS DISPALYED ON ALL DB2I TASK PANELS.
*
*
MIGRATION CONCERNS
------------------
*
ALL REFERENCES TO DB2 LIBRARIES WILL NEED TO BE CHANGED TO REFLECT
NEW LIBRARY NAMES. WE WILL ATTEMPT TO WORK WITH CHANGE MANAGEMENT TO
CHANGE CA7 JOBS IN MASS. OTHER BATCH JOBS, LINK EDITS, UTILITY JOBS
AND ANY OTHER REFERENCES WILL NEED TO BE CHANGED.
*
NO NEW VERSION 3 FEATURES SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED OR TESTED UNTIL THE
INITIAL BACKOFF WINDOW IS PASSED. BACKOFF IS MORE COMPLEX AFTER NEW
FEATURES ARE USED. THIS PERIOD SHOULD NOT EXCEED 24 HRS.
*
ALL APPLICATIONS WILL NEED TO TEST ONLINE TRANSACTIONS, BATCH JOBS
AND UTILITIES AFTER MIGRATION.
*
THERE IS A NEW SEMANTIC FOR THE CONNECT PRECOMPILER OPTION IN VER. 3.
IF YOU WANT TO PRECOMPILE AN APPLICATION THAT USES THE VER. 2.3 CONNECT
SEMANTIC AFTER VERSION 3 IS INSTALLED, YOU MUST USE THE VER 2.3 OPTION.
*
AFTER MIGRATION TO VERSION 3, INSURE THAT PROGRAMS USING DSNJSLR, THE
STAND ALONE READ INTERFACE, ARE SENSITIVE TO WHETHER THE LOG RECORD IS
IN VER 2.3 OR VER 3 FORMAT. THE HEADER IS DIFFERENT.
*
DATA ROWS POINTED TO BY A CURSOR DEFINED AS FETCH ONLY ARE NOT PROTECTED
FROM UPDATE AFTER IT IS READ, EVEN IF THE CURSOR IS STILL POINTS TO IT.
CURSOR PROCESSING DEPENDING ON THE ROW NOT BEING CHANGED AFTER IT IS
READ WILL REQUIRE CHANGES.
*
IN VERSION 3 IF YOU GENERATE A -904 OR -913 ATTEMPTING TO FETCH A CURSOR
THEN DB2 WILL CLOSE THAT CURSOR. ANY ATTEMPTS TO USE THE CURSOR WILL
GENERATE A -501. APPLICATIONS SHOULD COMMIT OR ROLLBACK IF ANY OF THESE
CODES ARE ENCOUNTERED.
*
VIEWS CREATED ON CATALOG TABLES MAY NEED TO BE RECREATED.
*
VERSION 3 DOES NOT SUPPORT CATALOG VISABILITY.
*
SOME PLANS MAY REQUIRE REBINDING. WE WILL PROVIDE A LIST IN ADVANCE.
*
ALL RUNSTATS STATISTICS ARE NOW IN A NEW CATALOG TABLESPACE
SYSIBM.STSSTATS.
*
SYSTEM PLAN NAMES DSNTEP23, DSNTIA23 AND DSNTIB23 WILL BE CHANGED TO
DSNTEP99, DSNTIA99 AND DSNTIB99. ALL REFERENCES MUST BE CHANGED.
*
