** CREATED BY CJR
**
** STEPS FOR INSTALLING/ACTIVATING DDF ON AN ESTABLISHED SUBSYSTEM
** (THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT INCLUDE TUNING OPTIONS, JUST THE BASICS TO
**  GET THE SUBSYSTEMS COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER.)
**
- CREATE DXXXDIST ADDRESS SPACE AND ADD TO SYS2.PROCLIB
- CHOOSE 2 NAMES FOR EACH SUBSYSTEM THAT WILL BE PARTICIPATING IN
  DISTRIBUTED FLOW:  A LOCATION NAME AND AN LU NAME.
  - LOCATION NAME SHOULD BE THE SSID AND  LU NAME CAN ALSO BE SSID, IF
    AGREED UPON WITH COMMUNICATIONS GROUP.  (LUNAME IS THEIR CALL)
- NEXT 2 ITEMS USUALLY DONE IN CONJUNCTION W/COMMUNICATIONS GROUP:
  - DEFINE DB2 TO VTAM VIA VTAM APPL STATEMENT IN SYS1.VTAMLST
    (RECOMMENDED/REQUIRED OPTIONS FOR DB2 FOUND IN 3-11 THRU 3-15).
    THIS APPLID MUST BE ACTIVATED PRIOR TO TRYING TO START DB2'S DDF.
    COMMAND IS AS FOLLOWS:
    /VARY NET,ACT,ID=DXXXAPPL
  - DEFINE, IF NOT ALREADY DONE SESSION MODES TO BE USED.  THERE ARE
    2 DEFAULT MODE ENTRIES:  IBMDB2LM AND IBMRDB WHICH MUST BE AVAIL,
    AND SHOULD BE ON EACH MVS.
- UPDATE OR CREATE SEPARATE DSNZPARM FOR USE WHEN STARTING DDF.  THE
  FOLLOWING PARMS PROBABLY REQUIRE CHANGES:
     MAXDBAT, CONDBAT, DDF, RESYNC, AND CMSTAT
  RUN DSNJUZ JOB FOR YOUR NEW ZPARM MEMBER TO BE ADDED TO SDSNEXIT.
- RUN DSNJU003 TO ADD DDF TO THE BSDS.
- CREATE THE CDB TO BE USED.  JCL IN 'D73294X.DBSS.CJRSQL(DDFADD)' OR
  PAGES 3-45 THRU 3-48.  REQUIRED IF THIS DB2 WILL BE REQUESTING
  DATA FROM REMOTE SYSTEM.  IF ONLY SERVER, OPTIONAL.
- VERIFY SUBSYSTEM WILL START WITH DDF.  IF YOU PICKED COMMAND FOR
  DDF ZPARM OPTION, YOU WILL NEED TO ISSUE START COMMAND FOR DDF
  ONCE DB2 IS UP:
  /-:START DDF
- RUN THROUGH IVP/
- OPTIONAL:  CREATE ALIASES AT EACH LOCATION FOR TABLES TO BE
  ACCESSED USING SYSTEM-DIRECTED ACCESS FROM OTHER LOCATIONS.  THIS
  WILL EXCLUDE PROGRAMMERS FROM HAVING TO KNOW 3-PART NAMES.
